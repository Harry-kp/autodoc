## 🌟 How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs 🐛

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues to avoid duplicates. When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
- **Provide specific examples** (code snippets, workflow files, etc.)
- **Describe the behavior you observed** and what you expected
- **Include screenshots** if relevant
- **List your environment details** (OS, GitHub Copilot version, etc.)

Use the [bug report template](https://github.com/Harry-kp/autodoc/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

### Suggesting Features 💡

Feature suggestions are welcome! Before creating a feature request:

- **Check if the feature has already been suggested**
- **Provide a clear and detailed explanation** of the feature
- **Explain why this feature would be useful** to most AutoDoc users
- **List any alternatives you've considered**

Use the [feature request template](https://github.com/Harry-kp/autodoc/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

### Pull Requests 🚀

Good pull requests (patches, improvements, new features) are fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g., implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending time on something that might not be merged.

#### Pull Request Process:

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Follow the code style** of the project
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Update documentation** (README, DEMO, etc.) if needed
5. **Write a clear commit message** describing what and why
6. **Reference any related issues** in your PR description
7. **Be patient** - I'll review as soon as possible!

#### Commit Message Guidelines:

```
feat: add support for MkDocs documentation
fix: resolve workflow trigger issue on PR merge
docs: update installation instructions
refactor: simplify agent configuration
test: add workflow validation tests
chore: update dependencies
```

### Code Review Process

I ([@Harry-kp](https://github.com/Harry-kp)) will review your pull request. I may suggest changes, improvements, or alternatives. Please don't take it personally - the goal is to maintain code quality and consistency.

**Response time:** I aim to respond within 3-5 business days.
